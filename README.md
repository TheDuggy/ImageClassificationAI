# Image Classification AI
### Made by a student  

This is small project of mine I did for an english-presentation. Feel free to check it out!

License: [Apache License V2.0](LICENSE.txt)

Data-Set: [animals10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10)

üìö Some other helpful resources I can really recommend by my self: 
- A Python focused [Discord-Server](https://discord.com/invite/python)
- A programming focused [Discord-Server](https://discord.gg/programming)
- The official [TensorFlow-Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Just a quick explanation of the folder structure:

üìÅ`./src/`:  
Contains the source-code for the actual ai. The sources are ones in jupyter-notebook form and also in the form of a normal python script

üìÅ `./ai/`:  
Contains the `.h5`-file, which is the fully trained ai, along with some training-date and the classes it has been trained with

üìÅ `./ui/`:
Contains the `.ui` files for the GUI generated by QT Designer in XML, stylesheet(s) and font(s)

üìÑ `requirements.txt`:  
The pip dependencies

üìÑ `main.py`:  
The actual program which loads the ai and GUI

<br>  

### How to run it ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

<br>

I made and tested the whole AI and GUI in Python 3.11.2 so feel free to download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You are maybe also required to update your pip-version when having some problems.

After downloading Python, download and unpack the zip-file of this repo or just clone this repo with the following command:  
```
git clone https://github.com/TheDuggy/ImageClassificationAI.git
```

Now just open a terminal in the most upper dir of the repo and install the following dependencies with the following command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install following dependencies:  
```
colorama
matplotlib
numpy
Pillow
PyQt5
tensorflow
tensorflow_intel
```

After that you can just run the main.py file as normal and it will open the GUI:

```
python main.py
```
<br> 

### Stylesheets üé®
<br> 

There is also a gruvbox based darktheme, which is located at `./ui/style/default_dark.qss`. If you want you can also add your own stylesheets to the application. Just add the argument `--stylesheet=<PATH_TO_YOUR_STYLESHEET>`!  
E.g.: 
```
python main.py --stylesheet=/path/to/my/awesome/stylesheet.qss
```
This will apply css code to the app. For further information look at the default stylesheet in `./ui/style/default_light.qss` or in the [docs](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-examples.html).  
One quick information for using custom fonts. You have to edit the src code of the actual application and load the font on startup if you don't want to install it on each system in order to use it in css.  
This can look like the following:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...  
    QFontDatabase.addApplicationFont('path/to/my/awesome/font.otf')
    ...
```
