# Image Classification AI
### Made by a student  

This is small project of mine I did for an english-presentation. Feel free to check it out!

Data-Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10

📚 Some other helpful resources I can really recommend by my self: 
- A Python focused [Discord-Server](https://discord.com/invite/python)
- A programming focused [Discord-Server](https://discord.gg/programming)
- The official [TensorFlow-Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Just a quick explanation of the folder structure:

📁`./src/`:  
Contains the source-code for the actual ai. The sources are ones in jupyter-notebook form and also in the form of a normal python script

📁 `./ai/`:  
Contains the `.h5`-file, which is the fully trained ai, along with some training-date and the classes it has been trained with

📁 `./ui/`:
Contains the `.ui` files for the GUI generated by QT Designer in XML

📄 `requirements.txt`:  
The pip dependecies

📄 `main.py`:  
The actual program which loads the ai and GUI

### How to run it

<br>

I made and tested the whole AI and GUI in Python 3.11.2 so feel fre to download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

After downloading Python, download and unpack the zip-file of this repo or just clone this repo with the following command:  
```
git clone https://github.com/TheDuggy/ImageClassificationAI.git
```

Now just open a terminal in the most upper dir of the repo and insall the following dependencies with the following command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install following dependecies:  
```
numpy: 1.23.5
Pillow: 9.4.0
PyQt5: 5.15.9
tensorflow: 2.11.0
tensorflow_intel: 2.12.0rc0
```

After that you can just run the main.py file as normal and it will open the GUI:

```
python main.py
```
